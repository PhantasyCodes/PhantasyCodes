<p>With my degree in mathematics and experience in teaching, I was always looking for solutions to help students learn more effectively. Throughout teaching, I saw students struggle with learning because the tools we had were simply not successful in bridging the educational gap for students. I felt called to pick up Software Engineering with the goal of helping students learn more efficiently and fell in love with using tech to solve problems.
